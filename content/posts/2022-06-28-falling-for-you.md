I have a "Let's Listen" series of Facebook posts about my favorite album of all time, Weezer's Pinkerton, that's been going on for many years now. I think I did Pink Triangle and maybe The Good Life in previous installments? Not sure. I can't find the posts anymore (thanks Zuck).

Anyway, here's one of the best songs ever written. It's a little bit understated; it's the ninth song of the album, and relatively unknown compared to the rest of the album, but I think it might be the best song on here - Falling For You. Really, listen to the song and soak it in:

My favorite part of the song is right after the guitar solo, when he says "What could you possibly see / in little ol' three-chord me?" when I'm pretty sure this is Rivers' most musically complex song, and one of a few songs that uses _all twelve semitones_ on the staff. I saw a great breakdown of the music theory behind this song somewhere that explained it pretty well.
