Our site is looking prettier now. My friend Conrad is doing the design for the site; the above is a very early version of what he’s already designed, and we have a team working to bring it to life. I’m mostly in charge of the backend, but doing a little front end work on the API. We finally got a full game timer working; I based the code mostly on lichess’s. Why not use a fully functional thing for inspiration?

Josh C and I battle tested it for a bit with 1-minute games. (The card at the bottom right saying 15 0 is wrong, but we’ll fix that later obvs#). Also, there are some silly phonies on the board :P

No real issues, everything worked smoothly enough. There is a ton of work left to make this the holy grail of Crossword Game, but I feel great about the fact that a full Crossword Game can be played.

We are splitting up the work into manageable chunks to try to release this later this year, at least as a beta. Account creation logic, friends, chat, beautiful scorecard, a functional lobby, a good rating system, etc are on the docket for the next few months, and then analysis features, AI bots, built-in tournaments, etc will hopefully come in the near future.

Exciting!
