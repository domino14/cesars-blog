A small team of us have been working very hard on a project that I internally call "liwords". The inspiration is obviously lichess.org. Why not do for crossword board games what lichess did for chess?

This has been a dream of mine for a few years since I first saw that wonderful site. Although we are very far from being done, I hit a minor milestone recently on Twitch (I sometimes stream coding on Twitch).

There you can see several functions working (don't mind the UI, which is all over the place, some parts pretty, some parts broken -- we are working on fixing this).

The functions that work:

- Seek a game shows the seek on both player screens
- Clicking on a game being sought redirects both players to the game
- Tiles are dealt out and the game begins.
- You can type your tiles onto the board


The game logic is based on my Macondo project so it basically should work fine, but hooking it up to the frontend takes a looooong time. We are still quite far from being done, but making a little progress every day after work and on weekends.
