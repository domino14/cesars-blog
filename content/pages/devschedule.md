As a husband and father of two young kids I have very limited free time, especially since my day job is co-founder of a startup (Check us out: [CodeComet](https://codecomet.io)). So when I can find a few free hours here and there I'll be working on some open-source project.

I am always working on a bunch of stuff. I have a lot of ideas that I explore and/or abandon temporarily, but I almost always go back to them eventually. It may frustrate some people when I say something is a "few weeks away" but it takes months to get out. This page is meant to show a more detailed breakdown of the stuff I am working on across my various projects. It should hopefully also elucidate why I keep jumping around between ideas.

### Aerolith

(Updated 10/1/2024)

[Aerolith](https://aerolith.org) is the OG CÃ©sar open-source project. I started it in 2007 as a Qt Desktop app and it became pretty popular among the Scrabble community.

It's been in maintenance mode for a very long time, but whenever there is a new lexicon update, I work on it for a few hours to get everything up to date.

Lately, however, someone on the [Woogles Discord](https://discord.gg/GqkUqA7ENm) brought up an algorithm called [FSRS](https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/fsrs4anki/wiki/ABC-of-FSRS). It's supposed to be a more efficient and better Spaced Repetition algorithm. I really want to learn the words better so I am implementing something that should be ready "in a few weeks". (Hopefully sooner, at least as a proof-of-concept). The bulk of the backend work is in [word_db_server](https://github.com/domino14/word_db_server) which is the microservice used by Aerolith that deals with all the word/lexicon-related stuff. The backend work is basically complete.

I'm calling the product "WordVault". You can have a few thousand cards for free but donate to get unlimited cards :)

Ideas/Work:

- WordVault/FSRS (hopefully proof-of-concept released by mid-October 2024)
- Update to CSW24 (by December 2024)

Integrating FSRS with the deeper Aerolith ecosystem will probably take a bit longer.
