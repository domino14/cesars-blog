César fell in love with technology at the tender age of 8, while a child in his native Caracas, Venezuela. His older brother had a Casio calculator and through trial and error, César figured out how to program it to play a simple number guessing game. He also ended up draining his brother's calculator battery before a big test, much to his brother's dismay.

César fell in love again in a different way many years later, and he currently lives in New Jersey with his beautiful wife and most amazing little boy in the world.

César was a late co-founder at a YCombinator startup (Leftronic, S2010), which was acquired in 2014 by AppDirect. He currently works at Pindrop as a senior software architect, and in his spare time dabbles in Scrabble-related side projects (See [Woogles](https://woogles.io), [Aerolith](https://aerolith.org), and [Macondo](https://domino14.github.io/macondo)). You can catch him streaming coding and Scrabble sometimes on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/14domino).
